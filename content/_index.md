*I want to remember, a lot.*
The reason I say that is, that I often get this extremely great solutions and then I just forget them.  


For example, One time, I decided I would never dream of marrying a woman on the first instant we met and I had a pretty good reason for why I shouldn't do it. But for some reason, yesterday, I spend the whole day doing that mistake *(guiltyðŸ˜…)*.
You see I had a solid reason, why I should not do that, but I just forgot.

**I want to blog** because it helps me remember, why I decided to do somethings in my life.
Blogging is awesome, because I can not only have my awesome solutions to myself, but I can share with you and know whether my solutions are right or not.


I often do this with my friend over the phone and we will have a blast of time talking about solutions to various relationship problems, money problems, education problems, workout problems, belief problems and much more. *(We simply overthink though ðŸ˜‚)*
You will see all these things incorporated in the upcoming blogs.
